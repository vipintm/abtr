# Abstract : 

Tokens are popular in two factor authentication, where the first authentication credential is a fixed secret key s1 associated with the user and the second authentication credential is a dynamic secret key s2 generated by the token assigned to the user. Popular hardware tokens use a synchronized clock T along with a static secret key encoded into the token to generate a one time secret s2. The contribution of the paper is to eliminate this clock synchronization with the authentication server S and to detect unauthorized login attempts when an intruder is in possession of s1 or s2 but not both, with a high degree of certainty.
